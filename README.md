## Stack

### PocketBase

The backend is powered by [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io) which is used to store the sessions and users related information. It is an open source backend solution that's super easy to use and set up. If you want to run the project yourself, you'll need to install PocketBase and run the server for yourself.

### Docker

The project is containerized using Docker. You can build and run the project using the following commands:

* `sudo docker build -t padel-club .`
* `sudo docker run -p 3002:3002 padel-club`
